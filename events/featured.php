<p />Come and hear some awesome live music free at a concert presented by the IIT Bible Club.  The concert
will feature 3 bands from the Chicago UBF ministry.  Opening will be IIT's very own praise band - made up of 
IIT students and alumni.  Following that will be the Lincoln Park Praise band, our special guests from the 
Lincoln Park ministry.  Finally, our headlining act will be the Chicago UBF vocal team, who have prepared songs
and presentations for us to sing along to.  
<br /> <br />
<p />We will also have a special performance which will feature riffs from some very popular songs 
arranged with some Latin beats.  Come on down for good music, dancing, food and a good time - 
this is a show you do not want to miss!
