					<br />
					<br />
					1.  We believe that there is one God in three Persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. 
					<br />
					<br />
					2.  We believe that God created the heavens and the earth and all other things in the universe: that He is the Sovereign Ruler of all things; that the Sovereign God reveals Himself; we believe in his redemptive work and in his final judgment. 
					<br />
					<br />
					3.  We believe that the Bible is inspired by God; that it is the truth; that it is the final authority in faith and practice. 
					<br />
					<br />
					4.  We believe that since the fall of Adam, all people have been under the bondage and power of sin and are deserving of the judgment and wrath of God.
					<br />
					<br />
					5.  We believe that Jesus Christ, who is God and man, through his atoning, sacrificial death on the cross for our sins and his resurrection, is the only way of salvation; he alone saves us from sin and judgment and purifies us from the contamination of the world caused by sin.
					<br />
					<br />
					6.  We believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead, ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father.
					<br />
					<br />
					7.  We believe that regeneration is by the work of the Holy Spirit, and that it is necessary if one is to enter the kingdom of God. We believe that God sent his Holy Spirit to empower his church to witness to Jesus to the ends of the earth.
					<br />
					<br />
					8.  We believe that we are made righteous by grace alone, through faith alone.
					<br />
					<br />
					9.  We believe that the Holy Spirit works in the heart of every believer to lead him.
					<br />
					<br />
					10.  We believe that the church is the body of Christ and that all Christians are members of it.
					<br />
					<br />
					11.  We believe that Jesus will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead.

					<br />
					<br />
					<u>Sunday Worship Service</u>
					<br />
					<br />
					Sunday Worship Services are held weekly at the IIT Chapel.  Due to renovations on the chapel in the Summer 2009, the worship services will be held in the HUB Ballroom - East until further notice.  We are expected to be back in the chapel Aug 30, 2009.
					<br />
					<br />
					<u>Sharing the Gospel</u>
					<br />
					<br />
					We seek to share the gospel with the IIT community and invite students and others to study the Bible.
					<br />
					<br />
					<u>One-to-One Bible Study</u>
					<br />
					<br />
					U.B.F. emphasizes one-to-one Bible study. One who has studied a lesson or a passage prepares by prayer and personal study, then he/she invites another student to study the Bible with him/her. They agree on a mutually convenient place and time, using prepared Bible study question sheets and read and discuss the Bible passage together. They seek to understand the message of the passage, pray together and encourage each other to apply the Bible teaching to personal life. After each Bible study, students are encouraged to write their own testimonies about what they have learned. By writing a testimony, the word of God can be planted in their hearts. 
					<br />
					<br />
					<u>Group Bible Studies</u>
					<br />
					<br />
					Group Bible study is also encouraged. Group Bible studies are sometimes held on campuses and sometimes in the Bible houses. Frequently the Sunday passage is studied in advance. Then, after the Sunday Worship service, members write and share testimonies. Large chapters are divided into small Fellowship groups. These Fellowships meet to study the Bible pray for one another and for God's work throughout the world. These Fellowships are also a place for leadership training.
					<br />
					<br />
					<u>IIT Bible Club</u>
					<br />
					<br />
					At IIT UBF Group Bible Studies are held for students with the IIT Bible Club, meeting weekly during the semester in the MTCC.  This is a time for Bible Study and fellowship, and the goal is to encourage one another to grow deeper in a relationship with Christ and with one another.  On occasion, we meet for activities from movies to bowling to stopping in at our favorite local restaurants.  Please come join us!
					<br />
					<br />		
					<u>Friday Leaders Meetings</u>
					<br />
					<br />			
					On Friday, Leader's meetings are held at 7pm in E1 for ministry staff, students and alumni.  Testimonies are shared, along with group Bible studies or topical discussions.  
					<br />
					<br />
					<u>Semi-Annual Retreats</u>
					<br />
					<br />
					 Each year, we plan and organize Easter and Summer Retreats, which are usually over the weekends held at various conference and retreat locations in the Midwest.  It is a great chance to take some time out of the busy-ness of our lives to dedicate time to focus on the Word of God and grow in fellowship with one another.  It is also a wonderful opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors and on occasion, fellowship with ministries from other Chicagoland college campuses.
					<br />
					<br />
					<u>Christmas Worship Service</u>
					<br />
					<br />
					Each year, our ministry joins with all other Chicago ministries to attend a special extended Christmas worship service.  In addition to the Christmas message, there are music, dancing and drama performances celebrating the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Afterwards our fellowship meets together for a hearty Christmas banquet!  Come and share the holidays with us!
					<br />
					<br />
					<u>Outreach Concerts</u>
					<br />
					<br />
					Since 2007 we have had an annual Outreach concert to sing praises to our Lord and encourage one another with music and singing.  Details are posted in our events section on the website near concert dates.
